# Securing your API with Client ID and Client Secret 




## Objective

This labl will guide you through securing your API with Client ID and Client Secret. When applications are registered in your Developer Portal, a Client ID is generated to identify the application. Optionally, a Client Secret, which serves as a password, can also be generated. Applications would need to supply the generated Client ID and Client Secret keys in order to access your API.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have completed one of the  **lab1**.

## Set the identification mechanism of your API

1. Navigate to your API's Design view:  
   a. Click on **Drafts** in the left-navigation panel  
   b. Then click on the **APIs** tab  
   c. Click on the _**Weather Provider API**_ that you created in the previous tutorial. This opens the API's **Design** view.

2. In the Design view:
    a. Scroll down to **Security Definitions**.  
    b. Click the **Add Security Definitions** icon (+), then click **API Key**.  
    c. Add the two new API keys shown below. For both new keys, ensure that the "Located In" field is set to "Header".  
      - Name: Client ID;  Parameter name: X-IBM-Client-Id  
      - Name: Client Secret;  Parameter name: X-IBM-Client-Secret

3. Scroll down to the **Security** panel and add a new security option.  
    a. Select the newly created Client ID and Client Secret keys.  
    b. Save your API.  
    c. Switch over to the **Assemble** tab.

## Test the changes made to your API

1. In the Assemble tab, click the â–º button to test your changes.

2. In the Test / Setup panel, click on **Republish product** to get the latest changes. 
> This option updates your API product, and also publishes it to the Sandbox catalog.

3. After the product has been republished, click on the **get /current** operation in the test panel.
4. Scroll down in the Test panel, and notice that the Client ID and Client Secret values have already been populated. 
> These are test values that are generated for your sandbox, and represent the keys of the application that will be using your API.
> **Note:** The Client ID and Client Secret keys can also be found under Dashboard > Catalog > Settings > Endpoints]_

5. Scroll further down and enter a zip code (e.g. 90210). 
6. Click **Invoke**. _You should get a 200 OK response, along with the message body returning the weather information._
7. Now scroll back up to the Client ID field. 
8. Replace the Client ID value with a random one.
9. Rerun the test by clicking **Invoke**. _You'll see a 401 Unauthorized response, together with the message "Client ID not registered"._

## Call your API using the Client ID and Client Secret

The security settings can also be tested using the Explore tool that explicitly calls the proxy endpoint, and passes the Client ID and Client Secret keys as header values.

1. Click **Explore**, then click **Sandbox**.

2. Click on the **GET /current** operation from the list.

3. In the right-hand column, click **Call operation** to rerun the test.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to set the identification mechanism of your API, test changes made to your API, and call your API using the Client ID and Client Secret.
